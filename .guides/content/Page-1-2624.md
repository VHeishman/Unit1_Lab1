Your dream is to breed a race of rats the size of bullmastiffs.  You'll start with Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat, and breed generation after generation until your dream comes true!

The average brown rat weighs anywhere from 250-350 grams (0.5-0.75 lbs) and the average bullmastiff can weight anywhere from 45000-60000 grams (100-130 lbs).

### Statistics Vocabulary

- Fitness: how well a data set fulfills a set of expected values (actual vs target)
- Mean: average, sum of all values divided by the number of values
- Median: the center of sorted numerical data
- Mode: the most frequently occurring value

### Provided Information

- The constants to be used throughout this program to set up and execute your experiment.  Paste these below your heading.

```python
GOAL = 50000                # Target average weight (grams)
NUM_RATS = 20               # Max adult rats in the lab
INITIAL_MIN_WT = 200        # The smallest rat (grams)
INITIAL_MAX_WT = 600        # The chonkiest rat (grams)
INITIAL_MODE_WT = 300       # The most common weight (grams)
MUTATE_ODDS = 0.01          # Liklihood of a mutation
MUTATE_MIN = 0.5            # Scalar mutation - least beneficial
MUTATE_MAX = 1.2            # Scalar mutation - most beneficial
LITTER_SIZE = 8             # Pups per litter (1 mating pair)
GENERATIONS_PER_YEAR = 10   # How many generations are created each year
GENERATION_LIMIT = 500      # Generational cutoff - stop breeded no matter what
```

- The function used to create the first generation of rats.

```python
def initial_population():
  '''Create the initial set of rats based on constants'''
  rats = [[],[]]
  mother = Rat("F", INITIAL_MIN_WT)
  father = Rat("M", INITIAL_MAX_WT)
  
  for r in range(NUM_RATS):
    if r < 10:
      sex = "M"
      ind = 0
    else:
      sex = "F"
      ind = 1
  
    wt = calculate_weight(sex, mother, father)
    R = Rat(sex, wt)
    rats[ind].append(R)
  
  return rats
```
---
- The calculate weight functions is used to determine the weight of a single rat, based on the mother, father, and sex of the new rat

```python
def calculate_weight(sex, mother, father):
  '''Generate the weight of a single rat'''
  
  
  # Use the triangular function from the random library to skew the 
  #baby's weight based on its sex
  '''
  if sex == "M":
    wt = int(triangular(min, max, max))
  else:
    wt = int(triangular(min, max, min))
  '''
  return wt
```
---
- The mutate function applies mutation odds to each selected pup

```python
def mutate(pups):
  """Check for mutability, modify weight of affected pups"""

  return pups  
```
---
- The breed function creates mating pairs and generates a new litter for each pair.  All new pups are added to a list.

```python
def breed(rats):
  """Create mating pairs, create LITTER_SIZE children per pair"""
  

  return children  
```
---
- The select function selects the best 10 males and best 10 females for the next round of breeding.  **Rats that have had 5 litters or more are excluded from the selection and cannot go on to breed.**

```python
def select(rats, pups):
  '''Choose the largest viable rats for the next round of breeding'''

  return rats, largest
```
---
- The calculate mean function determines the mean weight for the most recently bred population of rats

```python
def calculate_mean(rats):
  '''Calculate the mean weight of a population'''

  return sumWt // numRats
```
---
- The fitness function decides whether the program has met the goal - is the mean weight of the population greater than or equal to the target weight?

```python
def fitness(rats):
  """Determine if the target average matches the current population's average"""
  
  return mean >= GOAL, mean
```
---
- The Rat class should be found in a separate Python file and imported into main.py.  Include the following actions and attributes in your class
    - Attributes
        - self.sex
        - self.weight
        - self.litters
    - Actions
        - init
        - str
        - repr
        - getWeight
        - getSex
        - canBreed
        - lt
        - gt
        - le
        - ge
        - eq

### Produce a report that contains the following information:

- Number of generations breed
- Average weight for each generation
- Number of years needed to reach the average target weight
- The weight of the largest rat created
- The time in seconds/minutes that it took for the simulation to run

### Project Specifications

In order to get your army of giant rats, you will need to complete the appropriate breeding and selection cycle.  To begin, you will generate an initial population of rats (function has been provided above).  From there you must determine the populations fitness (success?), eliminate the smallest rats, breed the best rats, and apply the genetic mutation.

- Create a separate Python file to house your Rat class.  This class will be used to create objects linking the rats age, sex, and weight so that our calculations are accurate.
- Breed until the AVERAGE weight for the generation is greater than or equal to 50000 grams
- All code must be enclosed in functions - implement all functions in main
- Your summary of results should be neat and organized - utilize whitespace, proper grammar,
- Code should be robust and not produce any errors
- Utilize multiple Python files - one file should be main.py
